conversation with Seth and his talking about how I was providing a
defined interface around undefined work

Mentioned how his image was 'opinionated'

"Running services in Docker provides a number of benefits, and those who
believe Docker is just about container isolation clearly miss the point.
Docker defines a standard unit of software that can have anything in it
and yet have a standard interface of operations."

That plus docker context made me put 2 x 2 together and get 4 this time

The reason I don't like docker is because the dockerfile seems too much
like vastexec, which, since I'd been able to conceptualize, couldn't be
hat great and needed to be improved upon

vastexec grew out of confsync, which was written sometime around 2009,
give or take.
