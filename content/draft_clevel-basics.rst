A short while ago, the CEO of my company requested that I find him some "Executive Summary" material regarding infrastructure. While I didn't do an exhaustive search for material that fit the bill I thought I'd take a stab at it myself.

In this series I hope to provide a 30,000 ft view of many technologies, where they fit, where they don't, and how they compare when there is overlap.
