Presenting at `Devops Days Austin
2015 <http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-austin/>`__\ was quite an
adventure. There were lots of great presentations there, and the hallway
rack is always great. If you ever have the opportunity to attend I'd
highly recommend it. Here's my small contribution:

`Devops in a brownfields
environment <http://www.slideshare.net/DouglasLand/devops-in-a-brownfields-environment-47805652>`__
