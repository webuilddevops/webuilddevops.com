# i'm using the pure theme for pelican: https://github.com/PurePelicanTheme/pure
you'll also need to install the slideshare plugin manually. The whole pip install thing is a lie!: https://github.com/looprock/pelican_slideshare

you'll also need these:
pip install pelican-youtube
pip install pelican-vimeo

pelican -t pure content
cd output && python -m pelican.server

the 'real' server runs 'make publish' so you can use distict values for pelican config vs publish config
cd /Users/dland/virtualenv/pelican/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pelican/themes/pure/static
